Program 5: Distributed File System

Programmers: Peter Collins (pcollins) and Brennan Schmidt (bschmidt)

This program is distributed file system based on the LFS paradigm.  The server idempotentent, so multiple calls of the same parameters won't corrupt the file system.  We tried to pass every test, but were unable to pass the drop test.  Oh well.  While waiting for the runtests to finish, we sshed in other people's computers and used to the write command to write on their terminal.  Such as below.

Here's an ASCII Cat

               )\._.,--....,'``.       
 .b--.        /;   _.. \   _\  (`._ ,. 
`=,-,-'~~~   `----(,_..'--(,_..'`-.;.'
